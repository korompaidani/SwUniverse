In Package Manager Console
add-migration "Initial migration"
update-database


Facts:
- If your Table(Entity) has an ICollection of an other entity (eg.: society collection in character)
EF will create the Society table with a CharacterId foreign key and the Character wont contain anything on db side

- Based on the fact above, when you are creating a character with societies (one or more) than EF will automatically fill your Societies Table as well. You dont 
need to fill it out manually.

- If you need a common table (collection table) they must contain the others keys and in context you have to call the following in OnModelCreating Method
    modelBuilder.Entity<CharactersInFilms>().HasKey(cf => new { cf.CharacterId, cf.FilmId });
    modelBuilder.Entity<CharactersInSeries>().HasKey(cf => new { cf.CharacterId, cf.SeriesId });

- Foreign key can be nullable
